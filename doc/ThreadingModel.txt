Unsorted Notes on the threading model

Repeated Tasks are controlled by Trigger objects.
A Trigger has an ascociated cycle time.

Triggers are distributed to threads by a scheduler which balances load on threads.
If a Trigger does not finish its jobs within one cycle an error is reported.

Cycle rates are multiples of a minimal cycle rate.

Different Clocks can be used to allow virtual time for simulations.
