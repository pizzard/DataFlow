during construction of Connection(lhs, rhs)
evaluate in following order, take first.

Get result_type from Component:

* if lhs::result_type exists, use that.
* if it can be evaluated use std::result_of(lhs(args))


Get arg of rhs

* unnecessary, static assert rhs is callable with lhs::result_type

get result_type from rhs:
* if rhs::result_type exists, use that
* if it can be evaluated use std::result_of(rhs(lhs::result_type))
